# "Build"

A game made for a small jam with friends with the theme **build**. Built in Love2D.


## Notes / TODO
- JRPG style world
- match-three-like gameplay
- vs bots?
- move bottom of playfield up gradually?
- consider dropping unattached pieces?
- tutorial text, NPCs and unlockable trinkets?
- draw where the piece will land?
- port to playdate (after jam?)
